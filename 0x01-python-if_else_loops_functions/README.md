### Description ###
Understanding concepts of the higher level language - Python.
### Objectives ###
* Why Python programming is awesome (donâ€™t forget to tweet today, with the hashtag #pythoniscool :))
* Why indentation is so important in Python
* How to use the if, if ... else statements
* How to use comments
* How to affect values to variables
* How to use the while and for loops
* How is the Python's for different from the C's?
* How to use the break and continues statements
* How to use else clauses on loops
* What does the pass statement do, and when to use it
* How to use range
* What is a function and how do you use functions
* What does return a function that does not use any return statement
* Scope of variables
* What's a traceback
* What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them
### Compilation ###
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using 'python3' (version 3.4.3)
### Requirements ###
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files should end with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the PEP 8 style
* All your files must be executable
* The length of your files will be tested using wc
### Zen ###
The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
### Tasks ###
#### Mandatory 0 ####
0. **Positive anything is better than negative nothing**
 * This program will assign a random signed number to the variable `number` each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable `number` is positive or negative.
 * [Source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x01.py/blob/master/0-positive_or_negative_py)
 * The variable `number` will store a different value every time you will run this program
 * You don't have to understand what `import`, `random. randint` do. Please do not touch this code
 * The output of the program should be:
	* The number, followed by:
		* if the number is greater than 0: `is positive`
		* if the number is 0: `is zero`
		* if the number is less than 0: `is negative`
	* followed by a new line
#### Mandatory 1 ####
1. **The last digit**
 * This program will assign a random signed number to the variable `number` each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable `number`.
	* [Source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x01.py/blob/master/1-last_digit_py)
	* The variable `number` will store a different value every time you will run this program
	* You don't have to understand what `import`, `random`. `randint` do. Please do not touch this code
	* The output of the program should be:
		* The string `Last digit of`, followed by:
		* the number, followed by
		* the string `is`, followed by
			* if the number is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5
			* if the number is 0: the string and is 0
			* if the number is less than 6 and not 0: the string and is less than 6 and not 0
		* followed by a new line
#### Mandatory 2 ####
