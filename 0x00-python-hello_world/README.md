### Description ###
First project to introduce the higher-level programming language - Python.
### Objectives ###
* At the end of the project, you are expected to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
 * Why Python programming is awesome (donâ€™t forget to tweet today, with the hashtag #pythoniscool :))
 * Who created Python
 * Who is Guido van Rossum
 * Where does the name 'Python' come from
 * What is the Zen of Python
 * How to use the Python interpreter
 * How to print text and variables using print
 * How to use strings
 * What are indexing and slicing in Python
 * What is the official Holberton Python coding style and how to check your code with PEP 8

### Compilation ###
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using 'python3' (version 3.4.3)
### Requirements ###
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files should end with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the PEP 8 style
* All your files must be executable
* The length of your files will be tested using wc
### Zen ###
The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

	* [ ] Write a Shell script that runs Python code.
	* [ ] The Python code will be saved in the environment variable $PYCODE
#### Mandatory 2 ####
2. **Hello, print**
	* [ ] Write a Python script that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line.
